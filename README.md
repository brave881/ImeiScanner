# ImeiScanner
Sure, here is a longer version of my last answer that avoids repeating myself:

IMEI Scanner
This project is an IMEI scanner app that uses the Firebase Camera to scan IMEI numbers. The app also uses Glide to load images from the Firebase Storage, and the ViewModel to manage the app's state. The app also uses the Phone Number Detector to detect phone numbers in the IMEI numbers. Finally, the app uses the Material Drawer to provide navigation between the app's different screens.

Getting Started
To run the project, you will need to have the following installed:

+ Android Studio
 * The Firebase SDK
 * The Glide library
 * The ViewModel library
 * The Phone Number Detector library
 * The Material Drawer library
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can open the project in Android Studio and run it.

IMEI Scanning
The IMEI scanning functionality is implemented using the Firebase Camera. The Firebase Camera provides a way to capture images from the device's camera. The app uses the Firebase Camera to capture an image of the IMEI number. The image is then processed by the Phone Number Detector to detect the IMEI number.

The IMEI scanning functionality is a key feature of the app. It allows users to quickly and easily scan their IMEI numbers. The IMEI number is a unique identifier for each device. It can be used to track devices and to identify devices that have been lost or stolen.


To Do
Add more features to the IMEI scanning functionality.
Improve the visual appearance of the app.
Add more screens to the app.
The app is still under development. There are a number of features that I plan to add to the app in the future. I also plan to improve the visual appearance of the app and to add more screens to the app.
